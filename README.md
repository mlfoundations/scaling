# [Language models scale reliably with over-training and on downstream tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08540)



This repository contains code for our paper [Language models scale reliably with over-training and on downstream tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08540).

To understand the scaling behavior of over-trained models (i.e., models trained past compute-optimal), we train 104 models between 11M and 6.9B parameters on three datasets (C4, RedPajama, and RefinedWeb), with various token budgets. We conduct 8 next-token loss evaluations to construct scaling laws that relate training compute, model parameters, and the amount of over-training to next-token loss. To better align scaling laws with downstream accuracy/error metrics, we additionally evaluate all models on 46 downstream tasks. We propose a power law that connects a model's perplexity to its downstream average top-1 error.

We hope you will have fun playing with our scaling testbed!

# Environment

Create the conda environment:
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Activate the environment:
```sh
conda activate scaling
```

# Examining our testbed
We release our loss evaluations in `exp_data/model/*` and downstream accuracy/error evaluations in `exp_data/evals/*`.
To make interacting with these evaluations simpler, we provide `scaling_explorer.ipynb`, which contains examples. Specifically, we include cells to:
* Load data for all 104 models, with 8 loss evaluations and 46 downstream evaluations per model.
* Fit loss and downstream scaling laws following the default configurations from Table 2 in our paper.
* Code to reproduce Figure 1 demonstrating our key results.

We hope that you will consider extending this notebook!

# Downloading models and inference
We release model weights here: https://huggingface.co/mlfoundations/scaling/tree/main

WARNING: These are base models and not aligned with post-training. They are provided as is and intended as research artifacts only.

To automatically download a model and run inference, for instance, for the 411M parameter model trained on RefinedWeb for approximately 32x compute-optimal (i.e., with a token multiplier of 640),
```
python generate.py --model-json exp_data/models/rw_original-d=1024_l=24_h=8-32.0.json --input-text <your prompt in quotes here>
```

# Training logs
For downloading training logs and loading (number of token token, training loss) pairs per run see `training_explorer.ipynb`. Because of the decentrialized nature of our runs, there are unfortunately a few training logs that are not present in our wandb.
